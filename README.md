# Biljartscorebord



Biljartscorebord is an Android app that acts as an scoreboard for the biljart game.
Biljart is the almost the same als billiards but it is played with the common rules used the Netherlands

  - Can be used (with a big screen) during games
  - Can be used with a physical numpad keyboard (via wifi or bluetooth)
  - Simple interface (not really...but it should be)

# The sourcecode

  - Business logic is in the models
  - All database related stuff (crud queries) in a single database helper file
  - Support for multiple screen sizes
  - Still busy working on a better userinterface...
